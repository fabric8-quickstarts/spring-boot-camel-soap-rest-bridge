= Spring Boot Camel SOAP to REST bridge QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to use Camel's REST DSL to expose a backend SOAP API.

===  Mainly purpose of this quickstart
1. A simple camel route can brige REST invocation to legacy SOAP service.
2. Security is involved for both REST endpoint and SOAP enpoint, both backed by RH SSO. Frontend REST API protected via OAuth and OpenID Connect, and the client will fetch JWT access token from RH SSO using https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3["Resource Owner Password Credentials"] OAuth2 mode and using this token to access the REST endpoint. In the bridge camel route, client identity is propaged from SecurityContext and when camel-cxf producer talk to the backend WS-SECURITY protected SOAP service, it will firstly use this client identity to fetch a SAML2 token issued by CXF STS service(which is backed by RH SSO as Identity Provider), and the SAML2 token is signed and put in WS-SECURITY header, and the backend WS-SECURITY protected SOAP service will validate this SAML2 token accordingly. The SOAP invocation also includes XSD Schema Validation. If the token validation is successful, the backend SOAP service will return response and the response will return to the REST client which initially sends out the request.

This example relies on the https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin[OpenShift Maven plugin] for its build configuration
and uses the https://github.com/fabric8io/base-images#java-base-images[fabric8 Java base image].

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.

IMPORTANT: This quickstart can run in 2 modes: standalone on your machine and on Kubernetes / OpenShift Cluster.

* When running in standalone mode, a standalone RH SSO instance must be installed, started and configured properly on the local machine. Since there is no standalone 3Scale avaiable, the standalone mode doesn't involve 3Scale.
* When running in Openshift Cluster, the RH SSO and 3Scale images must be installed, started and configured properly on the openshift.

== Deployment options

You can run this quickstart in the following modes:

* Kubernetese / Single-node OpenShift cluster
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to run this quickstart is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this quickstart on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on OpenShift 3.11 or later version, RH SSO 7.4 or later version and 3Scale 2.8 or later version.

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

In this quickstart, we will give detailed steps to run it on a local installed minishift.

. Start minishift 
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory 8GB --cpus 4 --timezone America/Toronto
----
Since we need to install RH SSO image(2 pods) and 3Scale image(15 pods) as pre-requirement, so we need start minishift on a powerful machine, with options "--memory 8GB --cpus 4". Also this quickstart, we need to issue security token, so the timezone matters because security token has expiration time. Ensure the openshift cluster uses the same time zone as your local machine(By default it will use UTC timezone)

. Add cluster-admin role to user developer
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
$ oc login -u developer
$ oc project openshift
----
We will install this quickstart in openshift project|namespace(this is also expected by default configurations of the templates involved), as well as the RH SSO image, so we need to add cluster-admin role to user developer.

. Create secret and link it to serviceaccounts
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create secret docker-registry camel-bridge --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \
  --docker-username=USERNAME \
  --docker-password=PASSWORD \
  --docker-email=EMAIL_ADDRESS
$ oc secrets link default camel-bridge --for=pull
$ oc secrets link builder camel-bridge
----
Since Openshift 3.11, the new default docker image server registry.redhat.io requires authentication. To be able to access registry.redhat.io, users need to create USERNAME and PASSWORD https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[here].
More details can be found https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/configuring_clusters/install-config-configuring-red-hat-registry[here], the ***6.1.2. Creating Service Accounts and Authentication Tokens for the Red Hat Registry*

. Add RH SSO image stream and install RH SSO with template "sso74-x509-postgresql-persistent"
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ for resource in sso74-image-stream.json \
   sso74-https.json \
   sso74-postgresql.json \
   sso74-postgresql-persistent.json \
   sso74-x509-https.json \
   sso74-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
 do
   oc create -f \
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/sso74-dev/templates/${resource}
 done

$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default

$ oc new-app --template=sso74-x509-postgresql-persistent
----
Firstly ensure RH SSO images are available from openshift namespace, and then install RH SSO with template "sso74-x509-postgresql-persistent". This template can save all RH SSO configuration permenantly, so the configuration won't get lost after openshift restart.
After we install RH SSO successfully on openshift, we should be able to see some output on the console like

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
A new persistent RH-SSO service (using PostgreSQL) has been created in your project. The admin username/password for accessing the master realm via the RH-SSO console is tprYtXP1/nEjf7fojv11FmhJ5eaqadoh0SI2gvlls. The username/password for accessing the PostgreSQL database "root" is userqxe/XNYRjL74CrJEWW7HiSYEdH5FMKVSDytx. The HTTPS keystore used for serving secure content, the JGroups keystore used for securing JGroups communications, and server truststore used for securing RH-SSO requests were automatically created via OpenShift's service serving x509 certificate secrets.

. Install 3scale in 3scale namespace|project
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project 3scale
$ oc create secret docker-registry threescale-registry-auth --docker-server=registry.redhat.io --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \

$ oc secrets link default threescale-registry-auth --for=pull
$ oc secrets link builder threescale-registry-auth
$ oc new-app    --param WILDCARD_DOMAIN="$(minishift ip).nip.io"       -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3scale/3scale-amp-openshift-templates/2.8.0.GA/amp/amp-eval-tech-preview.yml
----
3scale installation on openshift will start 15 pods, so we create a new specific namespace|project for 3scale. Also we need a new threescale-registry-auth(this name matters since it's written in 3scale templates) secret for 3scale(we can reuse the USERNAME/PASSWORD from camel-bridge secret).  We intentionally use amp-eval-tech-preview.yml template here cause it doesn't explicitly specify hardware resources so can be easily run on a local machine/laptop. After we install 3scale successfully on openshift, we should see output from the console like

----
We need to pass in two properties to camel-soap-rest-bridge image on openshift. One is the RH SSO server address on openshift, and this is
https://sso-openshift.$(minishift ip).nip.io. Another one is the backend soap server, in this quickstart, we run the backend soap server on the local machine, so pass the local ip address of your machine as -Dweather.service.host.( must be an ip address other than localhost or 127.0.0.1)

. Run the test
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----

-Dweather.service.host=${your local ip}
----
We need to pass in four properties to run test
1. sso.servder: RH SSO server address on openshift, this is https://sso-openshift.$(minishift ip).nip.io
2. camel.route.host: this is the address from which runs camel route. Since on openshift, we need use 3scale as API gateway, so this is https://camel-security-bridge-3scale-apicast-production.$(minishift ip).nip.io
3. 3scale.user.key: this is the user key we use to access 3scale API gateway, we can get it when configuring 3scale(As mentioned above)
4. weather.service.host: this is the weather service running on your local machine, so put your local ip(can't be localhost or 127.0.0.1, must be your local machine ip which is accessable from the openshift)

. Insight of the test
1. This test will start a backend SOAP service, which is protected by WS-Security Timestamp and Signed SAML2 token
2. This test contains 5 test cases, demonstrates 5 different scenarios
   - testRestClientWithSTS: this testcase is the most normal one which tests the whole flow of the quickstart. It contains several steps
       * Test client fetch an access token from the RH SSO. Here we use the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3["Resource Owner Password Credentials"] OAuth2 flow, which is no UI interaction involved and suitable for Java code based client/server request/response invocation.
       * Test client puts the access token as AUTHORIZATION header and sends a REST request to the Camel REST DSL route. And the Camel REST DSL endpoint is secured by RH SSO.
       * When REST request reach Camel REST DSL route, a GetBodyProcessor is used to extract user id from the SecurityContext of the HttpServletRequest.
       * In the route, the JSON payload will be transformed to SOAP payload, then the camel-cxf producer endpoint sends SOAP request to backend SOAP service.
       * Before the camel-cxf producer endpoint sends request to backend SOAP service, it firstly talk to CXF STS(Security Token Service) to fetch a Signed SAML2 token(StsSamlCallbackHandler).
       * CXF STS checks the user id from the camel-cxf producer which is saved previously in GetBodyProcessor and calls the backend RH SSO to verify the user id(KeycloakUTValidator) as well as fetchs the roles associated with this user(KeycloakRolesClaimsHandler) and generates a signed SAML2 token and returns to camel-cxf producer.
       * camel-cxf producer puts this signed SAML2 token into SOAP message WS-SECURITY header and sends to backend SOAP service.
       * backend SOAP service unsigns this SAML2 token and validates token(Saml2Validator)
       
   - testJavaClient: this testcase won't go through camel route, instead, it's a simple JAXWS API client which sends request to backend SOAP service, but without required WS-SECURITY headers, hence an exception is expected.
   - testRestClientWithIncorrectToken : this testcase intentionally sends a request with an incorrect JWT to Camel REST DSL endpoint and expects a "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" exception; this can prove Camel REST DSL endpoint is really secured by RH SSO
   - testRestClientWithSTSInvalidZipCode : We enable schema validation for the SOAP message, and this testcase intentionally sends a request which has invalid zipcode per the XSD and expects a "cvc-pattern-valid" error
   - testRestClientWithInvalidPayload: we have enabled clientRequestValidation for camel rest dsl, but we intentionally send a request which accept header can't match the produces definition in camel rest dsl, hence expect http 406 NotAcceptableException. This can verify the clientRequestValidation on camel rest dsl actually works
